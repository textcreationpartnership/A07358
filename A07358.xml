         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But the witty ſcoffe of <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> King of the Lacedemonians may well bee applied vnto ſuch, who when the Thrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans would needs put diuine honors upon him for his good deſerts towards them, ſayd: <hi>Deos vosipſos priùs faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, rùm deiſicandorum hominum poteſtatem vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis eſſe credam.</hi> Firſt make your ſelues gods, and then I will beleeue that yeo haue power to make other men gods.

This Worthy, whom I heere deſcribe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued more coſt then I haue, or was able to beſtow, and I confeſſe that her excellency compared with the ſimplicity
<pb facs="tcp:953:5"/>of this rapſody, or haſtened labour of mine, hath hither to deterred me from making it publique. But now, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I ſee it is expected, and I might otherwiſe bee bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at many hands, for neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of ſo great good deſerts, I haue aduentured it forth, and if I haue not ſo fully di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplayed her colours, as I might, the fault was in your too great ſecreſie, through which, her ſingular, pious, and charitable acts done by her in ſo great cloſenes, were hidden from my knowledge, ſo that I could not inſert them. And becauſe it is for her memory, that I have done this, I haue diuided it, deuoting to her as is moſt proper, the dedication, and
<pb facs="tcp:953:6"/>to you the conſolation. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take that which is yours, and whereof yee haue inſt cauſe, hauing a wife, a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther already ſo highly aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in heauen: of who I may without flattery, to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,<note place="margin">Pro. 31.29.</note> vſe the words of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muels</hi> mother, <hi>Many daughters haue done ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly, but thou fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounteſt them all.</hi> It is not, if it bee duly conſidered, your loſſe, and but her gaine, though I confeſſe it a great loſſe to vs all, for with the loſſe gaine redounds vnto vs. Whilſt ſhee liucd, wee could haue onely the comfort of one in the iourney with vs, now ſhe is dead, we may haue the comfort of one, our iourney-fellow ſafely come to the end
<pb facs="tcp:953:6"/>of the way. And this is a double comfort, the one for that one of our neere fellow-members is gone from miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to glory, the other for that in her wee haue beene more confirmed, who ſaw her ioyfull end, ſo many as walke after him. For wee ought to reioyce with thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce, and it was the ancient enstome of the Church of God, and now is to giue God thankes for the happy depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of good Chriſtians, in regard of their breaking the ice before vs, to the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of our hope, when wee ſhall follow after. Vnto this monument, for the further garniſhing, I haue added a diſcourſe of another <hi>Saint</hi> dying long agoe, which deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
<pb facs="tcp:953:7"/>to be engrauen in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with a pen of iron. And this I haue done to ſupply my wants, through defect of memory, in ſetting downe her ſpeeches and prayers: For looke what is heere ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in exhorting, in comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, in reforming, and in praying, was all in effect ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by her, if a regiſter heer of had beene made. And I haue made this addition the rather, that all the world may know, that in what faith, and hope, and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and iudgements, good Chriſtians amongst vs dye now a dayes in the ſame faith and affections the moſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and holy ſeruants of God died twelue hundred yeeres agoe. For let who ſo will look
<pb facs="tcp:953:7"/>with a ſingle eye into this Treatiſe, and he ſhall plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee, that <hi>Ierom</hi> held a particular faith, prayed only to God, profeſſing great boldneſſe, for that Chriſt was his brother, renounced all merit of his owne workes, and beleeued to paſſe imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to be auen, being ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with no feare of purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory fire, with many poynts more, which may eaſily bee gathered. But I forget my ſelf, I write too long an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle before ſo briefe a worke. I conclude therefore, and pray the God of comfort to fill you with true heauenly comfort to the end. <hi>Amen.</hi>

And whereas ſome things doe trouble the ſight of the eies, and ſome things againe do help and cleere it, ſhee that obtained a more cleere ſight by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouing the hinderances, and vſing the helps moſt carefully. The things that trouble the ſight are ſins, and the thing that hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth, is the eye-ſalue of the Spirit, that is the annoynting of the Holy

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:953:12"/>moſt carefully ſhunne all ſinne, keeping a moſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent watch ouer her waies, and by the daily humble acknowledgement of her infirmities, had her eyes cleered from the duſt of ſinne. And as touching the annoynting, this was plentifully diffuſed vpon her ſoule, there being in her a moſt fragrant ſmell of all Chriſtian graces.</p>
            <p>Firſt, ſhe was annoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a heauenly zeale as <hi>Mary</hi> the ſiſter of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus,</hi>

            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:953:12"/>
            <p>Neither the length of the way, the cold and wet of the winter, neither the buſineſſes of the world could hinder her feet from comming to the houſe of God. Vpon the Lords daies, vpon Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture-daies, and vpon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie occaſion of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhe was ſeene with the forwardeſt about the Lords Seruice. In her pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate familie, praiers mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and euening, reading of the Scriptures, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of Pſalmes, were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer wanting in manie yeeres.

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:953:13"/>ſpeeches by her continually miniſtred, to the breeding of grace in the hearers. By this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly exercizing of her ſelfe, then ſhee had her conuerſation in heauen,<note place="margin">Phil. 3.20.</note> and ſo could not but ſee her ſaluation there laid vp. <hi>Sicut corpus quod aëris pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate perfruitur, &amp;c.</hi> Euen as the bodie (faith <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi>) which liueth in pure and cleare aire,<note place="margin">

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:953:13"/>buſineſſes much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth the ſight.</p>
            <p>Secondly, ſhee was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted with wiſdome,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> as <hi>Abigail,</hi> who is ſayd to be of excellent vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. Shee did not loſe her time in hearing, reading, diſcourſe, and meditation; but profited more then many more ancient, to apply that of <hi>Dauid</hi> vnto her:<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.100.</note> 
               <hi>I am be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come wiſer then the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, becauſe I keepe thy commandements.</hi> Such was her vnderſtanding, as that ſhe could readily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite ſit texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for any purpoſe, and finde them out, and for harder places, by ſingular labour, ſhe attained good
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:953:14"/>skill herein. She was not like the dul Hebrues,<note place="margin">Heb. 5.</note> that were like babes in vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, when by reaſon of the time they might haue beene Doctors: but her knowledge with the time increaſed, ſo as that like a teacher, ſhe was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of great myſteries. Old nature was not ſo in her, as that ſhe ſhould bee blinded from perceiuing the things of God, but the new Spirit gaue her an vnderſtanding of all things,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.14.</note> as it is ſayd; <hi>The naturall man perceiueth not the things of God, but the ſpirituall man diſcerueth all things:</hi> She had doubtles then a cleere ſight of her ſaluation giuen by God,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:953:14"/>ſeeing that they which are thus inlightned,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.12</note> haue receiued the Spirit of God, whereby they know the things giuen them of God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ſhee was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted with true loue, cauſing in her plenty of good works, as in <hi>Dorcas,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 9.35.</note> her loue was exceeding great, both toward God, and towards her neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Of God, her loue was ſo great, as that ſhee burnt with the fire of ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt zeale for his glory, ſtoutly, euen beyond the ſtrength of her ſex oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſinne, and maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vertue in thoſe that were about her: As <hi>Dauid,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 101.7</note> in ſetting forth his zeale,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:953:15"/>ſo it may truely be ſaid of her; <hi>A wicked perſon ſhall not ſtand in my ſight.</hi> If any were neere in alliance, or great in worldly reſpects, yet if they were not orious for finne, ſhe tooke no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, but rather a lothing of their company. 2 For the loue of God, ſhe kept a continuall watch ouer her wayes, leſt ſhe ſhould offend againſt his holy will: no childe is more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayd of offending the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or maſter, then ſhe of offending God. 3 Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all watches, ſinne cannot altogether be kept out, ſhee was not a little troubled for her frailties and falls, being alwaies
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:953:15"/>glad when the Lord took the matter into his owne hands, by chaſtizing her with ſickneſſe: for then, and in health time alſo, ſhee did much complaine of her ſinnes and forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, for which it was neceſſary to be corrected. Her continuall bewailing, and often mourning, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen with teares, when wicked curſed ſpeakers were in preſence, did plainely ſhew ſuch an heart as <hi>Lots,</hi> ſo taken vp with the loue of God, as that hearing and ſeeing any thing againſt God,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2 8.</note> could not but vex the hart inwardly with ſorrow.</p>
            <p>Of her neighbour ſhee had alſo a true loue, not
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:953:16"/>in word, but in deed: She had loue of almeſ-deeds, which ſhe plentifully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to the poore, as <hi>Iob,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iob 31.16, 17.</note> 
               <hi>not eating her moſells alone, but the fatherleſſe did eat part with her, from her youth vp, the poore were nou riſhed vp with her,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 20.</note> 
               <hi>their loines bleſſed her, for that they were kept warme with her fleeces.</hi> Whileſt ſhee liued, the hungry could not goe vnfed, the naked vncloathed, the ſicke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſited, plentifully the Lord had dealt vnto her, plentifully ſhe gaue to the Lord againe in his poore members, appointing continuall releefe to bee giuen to the ſick and nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, in ſuch places of great
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:953:16"/>pouerty, as wherein ſhee liued not. 2 She ſhewed loue, by admoniſhing the diſorderly, inſtructing the ignorant, and exhorting the backward in religion, by all meanes prouoking to loue and good workes. O how great was her care, that her whole houſhold and all her neighbours might ſerue the Lord, that it might goe well with them for euer. 3 Her loue was exceeding great to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Gods Miniſters and all Saints, reioycing alwaies to entertaine ſuch, and to be in their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. 4 Her loue was ſuch towards all, as that ſhee would not giue offence to any, by ſpeaking ill of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:953:17"/>them, neither did ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light as many do, to heare ill reports againſt others. Wherefore her religion was not vaine,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.</note> as all is without loue, but it was a true religion, her purity was in heart and in truth, and bleſſed are the pure in heart,<note place="margin">Mat. 5.1.</note> for they ſhall ſee God. Her life was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall laying vp of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in heauen, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe could not but ſee heauen to be her dwelling place. She led a right An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall life, as <hi>Icrom</hi> tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeaketh;<note place="margin">

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:953:17"/>and men are An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel.: and if Angels, they ſee their ſaluation.</p>
            <p>Fourthly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> ſhee was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted with humility, as <hi>Mary</hi> the bleſſed mother of Chriſt, who being ſo highly graced by God,<note place="margin">Luc. 2.48.</note> yet acknowledgeth her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe fe his humble hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayden: Although ſhee had ſomething, whereof others are proud, as birth, riches, and eſtimation, yet ſhee was the ſame lowly hand-maid of the Lord. 1 Through humility, ſhe made herſelfe equall to thoſe that bee of low de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, being euen a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of the poore ones that feare the Lord. 2 She deſpiſed the ornaments
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:953:18"/>of vanity, which other women ſo much delight in, her outward habit did ſhew the inward lowlines and modeſty of her mind. 3 Shee ſtroue againſt the ſharpneſſe of her naturall diſpoſition, and by ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing did attaine a great meaſure of meekneſſe and gentleneſſe, learning of him that ſayd,<note place="margin">Matth. 11.</note> 
               <hi>Learne of mee that I am meeke and gentle, and ye ſhall finde reſt vnto your ſoules.</hi> 4 Like the poore Publican, ſhee was alwayes humbled in the ſight of her ſinnes, in health and ſickneſſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer flattering herſelfe with any thing which ſhee had done, but alwayes bewai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling her vnworthineſſe
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:953:18"/>and ſinnes, with which ſhe ſayd, that ſhe alwayes found herſelfe compaſſed about. 5 Becauſe ſhee thought herſelfe worthy of greater puniſhments, ſhe did humbly in all her ſufferings ſubmit herſelfe to whatſoeuer it ſhould pleaſe the Lord to lay vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her, verily perſwading herſelfe, that no ſickneſſe or griefe came by chance, but by Gods prouidence: Without murmuring or impatient complaining ſhe buckled her ſhoulders to to the yoke, often affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, that ſhee reſpected not any ſufferings heere,<note place="margin">Iam. 4.6.</note> ſo that ſhee might goe to heauen heereafter.

            <p>I anſwer, that this may happen euen in the true faithfull ſeruants of God, and yet their faith remain vnſhaken.</p>

Euen as the labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring man that ſerueth a good maſter, if his wages be offered him before the end of the day, that hee may bee diſmiſſed, hee is loth to receiue them yet, becauſe hee had rather hold out in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of ſo bountifull a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and doe him a full dayes worke: ſo the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full perſon, though he be

               </gap>umming the ſenſe for a time, ſo a that there is no feeling of comfort, but great heauineſſe. Thus the Lord leſus himſelfe in his extreaine paſſions was in a wonderfull agony, and heauy, till that the Angels came and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted him: and much
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:953:28"/>more the weake members of Chriſt, when their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are extreame, muſt needs bee heauy and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable, and loth to come neere death for a ſeaſon. Euen as the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer in the extreame heat of the day being pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with toyle and the weather, is without all comfort, although he be ſure of his wages at night: ſo the faithfull ſoule being ſcorched with the heat of extreame pangs, hath no feeling of comfort, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though hee bee aſſured of his reward at the laſt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, this falleth out through Satans tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, who then aſſaulteth moſt buſily, when we are
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:953:28"/>weakeſt, and heerein hee often preuaileth ſo farre, as that the patient can finde no comfort, though he prayeth againe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. Thus <hi>S.

Euen as the manly Souldier, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing fought valiantly, and a breach being made now in the wall, through which hee is entring the city, is notwithſtanding much daunted by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate Aduerſary, which maketh the paſſage very
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:953:29"/>hard and painefull vnto him, inſomuch as for a time there is nothing but horrour before his eyes, though hee ſeeth the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to bee ſo weake, as that hee cannot poſſibly be kept from the ſpoyle: So the Chriſtian ſouldier ſighting manfully all his life time, and the breach being now made in his laſt ſickneſſe, though hee ſeeth the riches of the new leruſalem, from which he cannot be ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, yet by Satan, now growing de perate, hee is ſo reſiſted, as that his brunt is very grieuous, and hee is much diſmayd. It is not ſo euen with wie ked perſons, for they lie
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:953:29"/>vpon their ſicke beds of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes with more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and euen quietly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part out of this world: but this is partly becauſe their pangs are not ſo great, they being ſpared here to bee the more tormented heereafter, and partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Deuid hauing them in his ſuare, is no way troubleſome vnto them, but rather as an Angell of light ſpeaketh all peace and comfort, till they be in the midſt of his lawes: As <hi>Eliſhahs</hi> ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant led the <hi>Syrians</hi> with hope,<note place="margin">2 King. 6.</note> till they were taken in the midſt of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
            <p>Wherefore let no faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full perſon bee diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:953:30"/>for the brunts which the godly ſuffer in their ſickneſſe, neither let the wicked be incouraged for the eaſie paſſage of ſome of the common ſort: for it remaineth firme: Such as ſee by faith their ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall depart in peace, and none elſe. Had wee not an inſtance of this in our faithfull ſiſter? Shee had brunts of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, brunts of pangs, and part of her day yet in the courſe of nature remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, &amp; young children, amongſt whom ſhe might think profitably to ſpend her time to Gods glory: yet howſoeuer theſe things might trouble her ioy, yet they could not all
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:953:30"/>take it from her. For vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Saturday growing very weake, and being much troubled for a time, ſhe yet profeſſed her ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt aſſurance, willing one that was then about to go to a friend of hers (a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle woman that had labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but could not finde aſſurance) to commend her vnto her, and certifie her what ioy ſhe had, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſhe vndoubtedly ſhould rather haue the like. Soone after this be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing through this ioy reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in her ſpirit, ſhe aroſe from her bed, and ſang moſt ſweetly ſaying, that it put her in minde of the ſinging in heauen. The next day being the Lords
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:953:31"/>day, when ſhe heard the family ſinging below in the houſe, ſhe ſayd, that ſhe ſhould be ſinging, ere, long in heauen. That night being prayed for ſundry times, when men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made of reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to health in prayer, ſhee ſeemed not to bee much mooued, but when heauen was mentioned, and being receiued thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſhee ſayd aloud, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; Soone after mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, ſhee ſayd, that ſhee had agreat conflict, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could wee conceiue what ſhee felt, but ſoone after moſt comſortably, <hi>He is come</hi> (ſaid ſhe) <hi>hee is come, the Diuell is ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, the world is ouercom,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:953:31"/>and the ſleſh is ouercome: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy hands (ô father) I cemmend my ſpirit:</hi> and ſo fell aſleep, her eyes being ſhut, and teeth ſet. But breath being perceiued to be in her, they ſtroue to reuiue her, which was a great trouble vnto her: Yet through the mercy of God ſhee obtained her olde comfort againe, by many ſignes teſtifying her aſſurance to the end, and departed vpon the Mun day-night, quietly falling at it were, into a ſleepe. And ſo ſhee is departed in peace, and reſteth in ioy with her beloued Sauior. So then happy is ſhe, but woe is vs from whom ſhe is departed, we may iuſtly

The ſhip that is cuery where ſound is drowned by one little hole. Men haue gone out of the way in this large
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:953:39"/>wilderneſſe, ſome ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting their neckes to the yoake of couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; others, like moſt filthy ſwine, being held in the filth of luxury, others occupied about the wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting away of things vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable: whence it commeth to paſſe, that the vſe of reaſon being caſt away, they doing like brute beaſts are made like vnto them, and haue not found the way to the new Citie <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> Such a mans way is an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth fould ſtreighter, then it is thought to be, and yet it is large to all ſuch as truly feare. Chriſt promiſeth to come to the <hi>Ceuturion</hi> fearing, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:953:39"/>to come to the pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie-King preſuming. All doe not truely obey the Goſpell. The time ſhall come, ſaith the Apoſtle, wherein men will not ſuffer wholeſome doctrin. Many preach, but all doe not preach the truth. They binde the hearts of ſimple men in ſinnes. They binde heauy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens in the leaſt ſinnes, and paſſe ouer greateſt ſinnes winking with the eie. There is a falſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour, a doubtfull ſword: on the one ſide he cutteth with his example, and worke; on the other ſide he ſmiteth and killeth with deceitfull, and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed words. How ſhould
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:953:40"/>the fire gine cold, and the water heate, how ſhould the ſtone go vpward, and how ſhould the filthy man preach chaſtly? And if he doth preach, what profit commeth hereby to the Hearers? What can hee that heareth ſay, but why doſt thou preach with thy voice that which thou denieſt with thy worke? He that ſpeaketh well with his tongue, and liueth ill, damneth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Behold the Pſalmiſt ſheweth, how acceptable ſuch preaching is vnto the Lord. To the Sinner, ſaith God,<note place="margin">Pſal. 50.</note> 
               <hi>Why doſt thou declare my righteouſneſſe, and takeſt my word into thy mouth, ſeeing thou hateſt to
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:953:40"/>be reformed?</hi> Many read great things, and learne hard things, diſpute ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilly, and ſpeake finely, that they may be honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the people, that they may be counted ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the common ſort, and yet doe nothing. If ye beleeue experience, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue me, the holineſſe of life doth more moue the hearts of men, then fine ſpeaches. Be Doers, and ſo preach: doing without preaching pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaileth,<note place="margin">Math. 7.</note> but not preaching without doing. God hath not ſaid, hee that preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the will of my Father, but he that doth it. I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praiſe not preaching, but onely in thoſe, that doe
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:953:41"/>not the things, which they preach. A Teacher of ſubtile wordes onely, and not of workes is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine light breathing into the eares, and a ſmoake ſoone paſſing away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fruite. Vnderſtand (ô brethren) vnderſtand what I ſay: he doth much better, that preacheth and doeth, then hee, that doeth, and preacheth not. If I onely doe good, I profit my ſelfe alone: but if I both preach and doe, I profit my ſelfe, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers alſo: According to which it is ſaid; <hi>They which inſtruct others in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſhall ſhine as the ſtars for euer, and euer.</hi> For Preachers are a light to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:953:41"/>inlighten with their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine hearts dimme, and blinde by reaſon of the cloud of ſinne, and that with the light of Chriſt, that ſhineth in darkenes. They are alſo for the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning of the word, which is the food of the ſoule, when it is ioyned with good workes. The dutie of preaching is inioyned euery one that knoweth; if he be a Doer. Yea that I may ſay more, hee that knoweth, and doeth one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and teacheth not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhall giue accompt to the Lord therefore. For ſeeing, according to the Apoſtle <hi>Iohn, He that hateth his brother is a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer, and he that hath this
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:953:42"/>worlds goods, and ſeeth his brother in neede, and yet ſhutteth vp his bowels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, hath not the loue of God in him:</hi> How much more is he a Murtherer and without the loue of God, who ſeeing his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of the way, and oppreſſed with deadly ſinnes, and yet knowing, how to doe it, doth not Miniſter vnto him the word of doctrine? Feare O ye Rectours and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, to whom the Lord inioyneth the duty of preaching, that we ſhould miniſter vnto his people the word of the Lord. For looke, how many die in their ſinnes, through your example, or negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:953:42"/>ſo many will the Lord require at your hand. For by how much the higher yee be in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, by ſo much yee ſhall be tortured with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter torments. Ye are not Lords, but ſhepheards. There is one Lord, and one cheife Shepheard, which knoweth his ſheep, and will require them at your hands. Alas how many are this day in the Church, not Shepheards, but Hirelings, to whom the ſheepe of Chriſt doe nothing pertaine? More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, that I may ſpeake truelie, and as themſelues know, they are rauening Wolues, which teare and diſperſe the ſheepe. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:953:43"/>nothing is worſe, nothing more abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, then when they ſcatter the ſheepe, which ought to keepe them. Alas what is done at this day by ſome, not ſhepheards of the Church, but Deſtroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which are not the leſſer part? They doe vnſatiablie deuour, euen like hell, the goods, and labours of men, and doe not onely not reforme them, from their ſinnes, but euen they themſelues doe draw them to things vnlawfull, either by their owne negligence, or by their moſt wicked inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or by their vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie workes in ſuch ſort, as that I muſt needes ſay, if
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:953:43"/>God ſhould leaue them being ſuch vnpuniſhed, hee ſhould be no longer God. And therefore as I haue often ſaid (my moſt deare ſonnes) ſerue the Lord with feare, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce before him with trembling, lay hold vpon his righteouſnes, leaſt yee periſh from the right way. Taſte, and ſee, how ſweet the Lord is. The rich haue wanted, and beene hungry, and ſuch as haue ſlept here in their riches, and pleaſures haue found nothing; but ſuch as ſeek after the Lord, doe want no good thing. <hi>I haue bin yong, and now am old, yet neuer did I ſee the righteous forſaken</hi> to the end, <hi>nor

               </gap>e out of pride as out of one roote? For when a man is made rich, and the glory of his houſe is increaſed, doth he not wax proud? and if he be proud, are not his wayes euer polluted? and then the rich man ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in ſecret with his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, doth deuiſe how he may ſlay the innocent. His eies look vpon the poore,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:953:45"/>and he layeth wait in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, that he may catch him, as a Lion in his den, ſaying in his heart, God hath forgotten, he hath turned away his face, and will neuer ſee. But when the Lord through pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence doth vſe more delay in executing iudegment, he is more full of anger, and therefore hee is an hundreth times more to be feared, when he doth patiently tolerate euils, than when he doth haſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puniſh. For God doth ſometime ſuffer the good to be vexed of the euill, and of the proud, ſo that they make long furrowes vpon their backs, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in their wickednes.
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:953:45"/>But though the Lord ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth a litle to forget the poore, yet he will not euer forget to be mercifull: for he is the helper of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſſe, and the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of the poore; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth the proud, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth grace to the humble. He breaketh the arme of the ſinner, and wicked one, and heareth the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of the poore, and iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the cauſe of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſſe, and of the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the proud man vpon earth may not exalt himſelf any more. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (my moſt dearely beloued ſonnes) if ye will be poore, be humbled vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the mighty hand of God, that yee may not
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:953:46"/>looſe thoſe things, which yee doe. Pouerty is no whit acceptable vnto God without humilitie. Hee choſe rather to take fleſh of bleſſed <hi>Mary</hi> for hir humilitie, than for any other vertue. For as out of the onely root of pride all euils do ariſe, ſo out of the onely roote of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, all good things are bred. Learne of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, who being gentle, and humble in heart, abaſed himſelfe for vs, becom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ming obedient euen to the death of the Croſſe. For which cauſe I ſay vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, if ye will be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, be obedient to euery humane power for Gods cauſe. He is not obedient,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:953:46"/>but negligent, who expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to be bidden the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coud time it is ſaid, that <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Andrew</hi> at the voice of one bidding left their nets, and all that they had, and followed the ſteps of the Lord. True obedience alwaies wiſheth in nothing to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a mans owne will, but the will of another. For Chriſt left this for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample vnto vs in his laſt ſupper, when hauing waſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed the feete of his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, he ſaid vnto <hi>Peter,</hi> that vnleſſe he would yeild vnto him, he ſhould haue no part with him. Wherefore (my moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued ſonnes) as yee haue one name, ſo haue one wil,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:953:47"/>and one will, for it is a good and pleaſant thing for brethren to dwell to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in vnitie. Let no man be greater, or leſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you, but after the example of Chriſt, let e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man be greateſt in humility. Let the greateſt amongſt you in humility become a fellow to the leaſt, when he doth well, but when he ſinneth, let him lift vp himſelf againſt vice through the zeale of righteouſnes. Neuer make any couenant with ſinne, let a man be loued ſo, as that his vice may be ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. It is a great ſigne of loue to reproue a man in all the leaſt offences. Vaine humilitie doth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:953:47"/>much hurt. It is no true humilitie to ſuffer vices by holding a mans peace. <hi>Cry out, ceaſe not, lift vp thy voice as a trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet,</hi> ſaith he to <hi>Eſay, tell my people of their ſins:</hi> and I would to God, that euery creature could cry out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſinne, becauſe that, although the ſinner doth not feare God, he would yet be afraid of men. The negligence, and vaine hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie of the ſhepheard makes, that the Wolues can bee bold againſt the Lambes. Looke not vpon the countenance of the mighty, for there is no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of perſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God. Do in all things that which is iuſt, ye muſt
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:953:48"/>rather obey God than men. If yee conceale the truth for feare of the mighty, do yee not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in your ſelues, that your righteouſneſſe doth not exceede the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes of the Scribes and Phariſees? Do not honor a rich man more than a poore man, vnleſſe he be better: Yea, that I may ſpeake truly, honor rather a poore man; for in a poore man doth ſhine the image of Chriſt, in a rich man the image of the world. We all come from one roote of fleſh, we are all bred members of one another in the ſame body, whereof the head is Ieſus Chriſt. What honor then
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:953:48"/>hath the rich and mighty man merited more than the poore man? Perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture, becauſe he is rich and mighty; but if it be thus, why do wee preach, that the glory of the world is to be deſpiſed? Surely I thinke, that no man is to be honoured for the vſe of euill things. If thou honoureſt the rich more than the poore, thou preferreſt the world before God, and if thou loueſt any thing in the world more than God, thou art not worthy of God. Giue, I pray you, the things of God, vnto God, and the things of the world vnto the world. Let goodnes euery where be
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:953:49"/>honoured, let wickednes be euery where diſgraced. But becauſe I am ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of thoſe that do glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in their fading riches, and of thoſe, that are proud of a certaine nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of the filthy fleſh, which is ſoone to returne to aſhes, and of vaine, and light power and dignitie (for they are lifted vp by the blaſt of ſome fooliſh titles, and doe tread o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers vnder feete through contempt, and by this they thinke, that they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that glory, which the Lord hath prepared onely for the humble, and for the contemners of this world) what ſhould I ſpeake of them, as it is
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:953:49"/>meete? woe to you that haſten to the kingdome of heauen through the way of riches, ſeeing that it is eaſier for a camell to goe through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdome of heauen. Theſe are not my words, but the words of Chriſt; if this ſentence be reuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, Chriſt is no more God. The <hi>heauen and the earth</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall paſſe away, but my words ſhall not paſſe away.</hi> Bewaile (ô ye miſerable Nobles, and Potentates) the titles of vnſlable fortune, becauſe yee are blinded with the fumes of the honours, and falfe dignities of this
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:953:50"/>world, when as the threed of your brittle life ſhall peraduenture be cut off this night, and ye ſhall be tormented in hell, more than others, world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end, liuing in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall dying. Yee are not amongſt the labourers in the world; yea ye do not onely not indure labour with men, but ye doe not ſuffer the laborers to liue; therfore ye ſhall be ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged not with men, but with deuils. For by how much your glory, and ioy hath bin the greater in this world, by ſo much the greater puniſhment is prepared for you in hell. We confeſſe, that Chriſt choſe twelue Apoſtles,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:953:50"/>amongſt whom <hi>Bartholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mew</hi> onely was of noble deſcent, and <hi>Matthew</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was rich, before that he was receiued into the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtleſhip, the reſt were poore fiſhermen. Now heare wherfore I haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated this. If Chriſt be true, and all, which I haue heard out of his mouth he true, amongſt ſuch kinde of men, ſcarſe one of a thouſand is to be ſound fit for the kingdome of heauen. But ſuch of them, as doe not beleeue mee, ſhall after a ſhort time feele it, when they are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in torments. Yet ſome man blinded from the light of the truth, will now maruaile: to whom,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:953:51"/>if hee would aske mee hereabout, I would an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. Do we not beleeue, that a man is damned for one ſinne? and if it be ſo, how can he be ſaued, that liueth in an hundreth thouſand ſins? But what other thing is the rich man, fed with the ayre of fading honour, but a rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten veſſell full of all ſins? Where is couetouſneſſe? where is pride? Is it not in the rich, in the noble, in the great ones? Are they not alſo theeues, which doe violently prey vpon the hire of the poore? and preſſe them downe, and kill them? who dowicked things out of the plenty of the Lords
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:953:51"/>houſe, which they haue receiued, that they might giue to the poore? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely they adde to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluitie in dyet, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluitie in apparell, hauing no regard to the poore, that dye through cold &amp; nakednes. They reare vp pallaces, and great buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, that they may be ſeene, when the poore dye in the ſtreets. They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide feaſts often for other rich men, that they may fill their bellies with moſt delicate diſhes, when the poore periſh through ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. What other is their life but ſinne? if the belly be filled with ſuch plenty of meate, is not ſurfet at the doores? And what
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:953:52"/>ſhould I ſay more, when the tongue of euery man would faile in telling the thouſands of ſins, which they do? Neither do they acknowledg God, vnleſſe it be by dreame; neither do they thinke, that they ſhall dye, as I ſuppoſe: for he that thinketh that he ſhall dye, and that God ſhall iudge him, doth not eaſily fall into ſinne. He is verily ouer weake, and miſerable, that hath not the remembrance of theſe things. Therfore to ſpeake truly, if they did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge God their iudge, and beleeued, that they heard, they would at the leaſt wiſe not ſinne ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely. Why doe theſe
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:953:52"/>moſt milerable men goe to the Church to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at diuine myſteries? whether that they may behold the countenances of faire women? this is their meditation, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and knowledge of God. If they looke into Gods law, it is but, that trauailing by ſea, or by land, they may gather money to themſelues, and their children by often watches, and diſtractions of minde, that they may be the firſt in changing their ſuites, through the wonderfull inuention of the workeman. But mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable men, what do yee, doe yee not conſider, that you deſtroy your bodie
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:953:53"/>before the time, and ſlay your ſoule? whence come weakneſſes, &amp; ſo vntime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deaths, but of the much plenty of meats, and of the often vſe of women? Doe ye thinke to mocke God? yee doe certainely mocke your ſelues: for the body yee forget the ſoule, and ye deſtroy both bodie and ſoule before the time. But delay not to do, what ye do; change your garments often, leſt your Nobilitie ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, if any man ſhould exceede you, that ye may receiue ſhame and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in hell. Where ſhall your feaſts, where ſhall your delicare diſhes then be, where your coſtly

Banquet, and be drunken, for yee ſhall do no more ſo after death, but being in hell tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yee ſhall with the rich man deſire the leaſt drop of water, and ſhall not obtaine it. Take your comfort in ſurfets, fulfill your pleaſures, ſowe in corruption, that of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption ye may reape that ſentence, which the iuſt iudge will giue in the great day of iudgement, ſaying, <hi>Goe yee curſed into heli ſire, prepared for the Deuill, and his angels.</hi> O ſtenle heart! that doſt not feare, that ſuch a doome hangeth ouer thy head, for the ſlender comforts
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:953:54"/>of this world. If thou loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt for that day ſo terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and cruell, wherein thou ſhalt giue account, not onely for thy ſurfets, and vaine apparell, and drunkenneſſe, and of thy time loſt, but alſo of euery euill thought, why art thou not amended? Why doſt thou wretch deferre from day to day to turne vnto the Lord? why doſt thou not now repent thee of thy ſinnes? Behold, death maketh haſte, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning night and day, that it may teare thee in peeces: behold the Deuill ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth haſte to catch thee: behold thy riches ſhall faile thee; behold the wormes waite for that
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:953:54"/>body, which thou doeſt nouriſh ſo daintily, that they may gnaw vpon it, vntill ſuch time as being receiued to the ſoule, it may togither ſuffer endles puniſhments. Why doſt thou ſeeke comfort by va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, wandring in the by-waies of this world? Thou canſt not finde true riches, and glory, and pleaſant things here, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not: but if thou ſeekeſt for true ioyes, haſten to that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly glory, for which thou wert made.

But why doe I ſpeake of theſe men, that will not ceaſe from ſinne, through loue and feare of God, or for the terror of death, and torments following after, but are grieued, if they cannot doe the wicked things, which they deſire?

But ſome man will ſay, the Lord is good, and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and receiueth in mercy euery ſinner that commeth vnto him. This is true indeede I confeſſe, the Lord is better, than he
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:953:56"/>is thought to be, he ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, as is meet, euery one, that commeth vnto him. Is he not a moſt kinde God, that tolerateth ſo great iniuries done vnto him by ſinners, giuing them ſpace to amend? But thou muſt know this, that as he is kinde in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing ſo he is iuſt in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing. But ſome man, perchance, will ſay again; he which hath done euill all his life, becomming penitent at the very point of death, obteineth par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of the Lord. O how falſe an opinion, and how falſe a meditation is this? Scarce one of a hundreth thouſand, whoſe life hath bin alwaies ill, hath found
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:953:56"/>this fauour at the Lords hands. A man begotten, and altogither nouriſhed vp in ſinne, which hath neither ſeene nor knowne God, neither hath bin wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to heare of him, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther taketh notice of his ſins, nor what repentance is, being altogither bound vp in ſecular buſineſſes, whom the ſtrait of forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his ſonnes preſſeth, whom weaknes paineth, whom the ſorrow of rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and temporall goods now about to be loſt ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, when he ſeeth, that he cannot enioy them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny longer, can ſuch a man make repentance accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table vnto God, who would not repent, if he
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:953:57"/>did thinke, that he could be healed? I may verily conclude truly, that he which doth not feare to offend God, whilſt he is young, and ſound, ſhall not be found worthy in death of the Lords par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. What repentance is that, which a man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth only, becauſe he ſeeth, that he can liue no longer? who, if he ſhould recouer from his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe againe, would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come worſe than he was before. I know no meane monyed men, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing repented them in their extremide, haue waxed well againe in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and worſe in life. I hold this, I thinke this to
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:953:57"/>be true, and haue learned it by manifold experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that he atteineth no good end, that hath alway led an ill life, which hath not ſeared to ſin, but hath alwaies liued in the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the world. Pretious (ſaith he) in the ſight of the Lord, is the death of his Saints, and moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed the death of the wicked. And therefore (my beloued ſonnes) gird your ſelues with power, be ye mighty ſonnes, and feare not the ſlender power of the rich &amp; migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty here, in the doing of righteouſneſſe. For he, that ſuffereth for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe is bleſſed, and if he ſuffereth death, he is
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:953:58"/>more bleſſed. If thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireſt to haue life through Chriſt, feare not death for Chriſt: for thou canſt not indure thoſe things for Chriſt, which are worthy of the glory to come, which ſhall bee reuealed, when our glory, which is from aboue, ſhall appeare. Let him not looke for a reward that doth not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; the name of a Chriſtian alone doth not ſuffice, but if thou beeſt a Chriſtian, imitate Chriſt. Hee hath in vaine the name of a Chriſtian, who followeth the Deuill. He is no Chriſtian, but an Antichriſt, according to that of <hi>Iohn: Ye haue heard that Antichriſt commeth, &amp;
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:953:58"/>now there be many Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts.</hi> Wilt thou there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reigne with Chriſt, then ſuffer with Chriſt. If Chriſt, the Lord and King, who hath a name aboue all names, ought to ſuffer, that he might enter into his glory, what hope haſt thou to enter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out paines? O how foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh are we, and ſlow of heart to beleeue? We will here paſſe our time in pleaſure with the world, and afterwards reigne with Chriſt. Seeing the maſter entred naked, ſhall the ſeruant expect to enter being laden with the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluitie of apparell of gold and pearles? He was full of faſtings, this man
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:953:59"/>of ſurfets and ryotings: he died vpon the croſſe for him, this man ſleepeth vpon a delicate bed. Shall ſeruants do that, which the Lord doth not? The Lord promiſeth his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to the ſonnes of <hi>Zebedee,</hi> if they could drinke the cup, that he ſhould drinke. Be yee wiſe, come hither, and heare me, and I will tell you the things, which I haue heard and knowne. It is good to cleaue to the Lord, and to walke, as he hath walked. Euen as Chriſt hath laid downe his life for vs, ſo we, if need be, ought to lay downe our life for the truth, which is God himſelfe. He
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:953:59"/>that loueth his life in this world, ſhall looſe it. Chriſt hath ſuffered for vs, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vnto vs an example, that we ſhould follow his ſteps. Let him not thinke himſelf a Chriſtian, which doth not finde himſelfe ready to die for Chriſt Let the miniſter of Chriſt follow Chriſt. Anſwer me (ô thou man) which art a Chriſtian onely in name and in word: doſt thou hold and preach the faith of Chriſt? this is a good thing, but where be thy workes? faith without workes is dead. Let mee tell thee truly, thou which praiſeſt Chriſt with thy word, and not with thy worke, doeſt indeed denie
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:953:60"/>who if thou didſt beleeue his ſayings, thou wouldſt at the leaſt be afraid, and bluſh to commit ſinne. And if thou doſt beleeue, and doſt euill, thou art to be puniſhed an hundreth fold more. Is not the ſin, which is done out of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice infinitely worſe, than that which is done out of ignorance? The Angell ſinned, and the man ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the one could finde pardon, the other not. For what cauſe? the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell ſinned out of malice, man ſinned out of the Deuils ſuggeſtion. Where vpon ſay I, thou doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe canſt haue none ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, if thou ſaiſt that thou ſinneſt by the Deuils ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:953:60"/>euen as he did, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thy ſuggeſtion is not like vnto his. He knew not yet, what the Deuils ſuggeſtion meant, neither how greatly ſinne would diſpleaſe: but thou knoweſt well, and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt, as thou ſaiſt, and yet co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitteſt ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand fins? And what ſhall I conclude? they that are ſuch Chriſtians beleeue him in word, and lye vnto him with their tongue, but their heart is not right with him, neither haue they faith in his teſtament. If any man loueth Chriſt, if any man be a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, &amp; ſpecially a Prieſt, in whom, as it were in a glaſſe, perfection doth
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:953:61"/>ſhine, he muſt deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that he may be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither dead vnto the world; becauſe that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe a graine of corne fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vpon the earth, dieth, it remaineth alone. He wandreth in the way, that haſtens to goe by riches, and delights. It is a ſigne of manifeſt damnation to follow the pleaſures of this world, and to be belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of the world. The Lord doth often correct, and chaſliſe thoſe, whom be loueth. If ye muſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the world, glory wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly in your tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and aduerſities: for Chriſt promiſed theſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Diſciples, whom he loued euen vnto the end,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:953:61"/>and that in ſigne of his chiefe loue, when in his laſt ſupper he ſaid, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erily I ſay vnto you, yee ſhall waile, and weepe, but the world ſhall reioyce.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioice (my moſt beloued ſionnes) when the world hateth you. Deſire to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer contumelies, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of men, becauſe ye ſhall be bleſſed, when men ſhall curſe you, and perſecute you, and ſay all manner of euill againſt you falſly for the ſonne of mans ſake. Know, that ye are not of the world, for if yee were of the world, the world would loue his owne. Thinke it all ioy, when ye haue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reproaches, and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:953:62"/>in the world, knowing that euen out of theſe doth ariſe valour, and patience, and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hath its perfect worke. Virtues are tried by patience, euen as gold by the fire. He that hath other virtues without pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, carries gold in earthen veſſells. <hi>In your patience onely</hi> (ſaid our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour) <hi>ye ſhall poſſeſſe your ſoules.</hi> Valour is ioyned vnto patience, a patient man is of a valiant minde, and he which is penitent, and valiant, may ſecurely hope for the good things of the life to come. Keep patience in your minde, and whilſt yee haue time exerciſe it in your workes.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:953:62"/>For patience is a couering whereby our ſhip ſaileth ſecurely in the ſtormes of this world, what winde ſoeuer bloweth, without any feare of danger. Let reproachfull words moue none of you to reuenge, or hatred of your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Be ye mercifull e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as your Father is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull, who doth raine vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the iuſt, and the vniuſt, and makes his Sunne to ſhine vpon the good, and the bad. Hee ſhall haue iudgement without mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie that doth not exerciſe mercie, and mercie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioiceth againſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If ye will not from your hearts forgiue ſuch as offend you, neither will
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:953:63"/>your Father forgiue you. He doth in vaine aske for mercie, which denieth mercie to others. Herein is our virtue eſtabliſhed, herein ſtandeth our ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, and reward, if wee lone our friends in God, and our enemies for God. That wicked ſeruant, which receiued mercie, and denied mercie to his Fellow-ſeruant, did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſerue to haue the ſeueritie of iuſtice. Iuſtice without mercie is crueltie, and therefore mercie is to be mingled with iuſtice. All our law is in mercie, God could haue condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all in iuſtice, whom he ſaued in mercie. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that wanteth mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:953:63"/>is no Chriſtian. It is almoſt impoſlible, that a mercifull, and godly man ſhould not pacifie Gods anger. Bleſſed are the mercifull, for they ſhall obraine mercie. A man without mercie is, as a ſhippe in the midſt of the ſea in euery part full of holes. The Preiſt, which diſſereth from the men of this world in apparell, yet agreeth with them in life. Cerainely there is no beaſt in the world ſo cruel, asan euill Preiſt, for hee deth not ſuffer himſelfe to be am ended, and can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer heare the truth, and that I may ſmiſh in a word, he excceds all men in naeghtineſſe. Alas how
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:953:64"/>much hath couetouſneſſe growne in ſome, that are ſpirituall in habit, and name, yea, that I may ſpeake truely, couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is the cauſe of this ſpiritualitie; who truely are rauening Wolues in ſheepes cloathing. If thou ſeeſt a Prieſt couetous, and without mercie, flie more from him, then from a Serpent. There are ſome, which thinke that all the fruite, that they are to bring foorth is to build Churches, and Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in a wonderfull man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, whoſe couetouſneſſe is ſo great, that they think the world, and all things too little for them. Their minde, and thoughts are
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:953:64"/>altogether ſet vpon this, that they may picke other mens purſes. Our Sauiour reprouing ſuch, ſaith, <hi>Woe to you that build the tombes of the Prophets.</hi> Behold they that build Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and ſet vp Churches of rare workemanſhippe ſeeme to doe a goodly worke: but if they ſhew mercie to the poore, that is a good worke indeede. Wouldſt thou haue thy worke to pleaſe God, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide, that the poore may haue ioy of it, what Church is more deare to God, then man? <hi>Yee are the Temple of God,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, when thou reacheſt out thy hand vnto the poore, when
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:953:65"/>thou ſuccoureſt a man in his neceſſitie. When thou bringeſt the wandring in to the right-way, Oh, what an admirable temple, and acceptable vnto God haſt thou built. Breake thy bread vnto the hungry, and bring the poore wandring into thy houſe, Let not man excuſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and ſay, I haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to giue to the poore, if thou haſt any garment, or any other thing beſides very neeeſſaries, and doſt not ſuccout a poore-man in want, thou art a theefe, and a Robber. Wee are (beloned) only Stewards and not Poſſeſſours of things temporall. One man hath ſo much more,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:953:65"/>then hee needeth, as an hundreth might hue vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which periſh thorough famine. Hee, that hath a little, and giuoth nor, robbes one, but ſuch rob beth ſo many, as he giueth not vnto being in want. But perchance thou wilt ſay (ô Wretch) it is mine owne, my Parents left it me. How could they leaue that to thee, which was not their owne? if it were their owne, whence had they it, who gaue it vnto them? what brought they with them, when they came into the world, what ſhall they carrie away, when they go out? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely ſuch things of the poore as wee poſſeſſe
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:953:66"/>will crie for vengeance in the day of iudgement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the eyes of Gods iuſtice. The law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture requires this, that what we deſire ſhould be done vnto vs, wee ſhould doe vnto other. What o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing doth the old law publiſh, and if thou aske the doctrine of the Goſpell, what other thing doth it infinuate? Theſe truely ſhall bee Witneſſes before GOD the iudge. What therefore ſhould I ſay to theſe, that onely gather together ſtones, and erect wals aloft, that their worke may appeare to the eyes of man, and that the building may be praiſed? Who is ſo foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:953:66"/>as that he vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not, that ſuch build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are not to the praiſe of God, but for worldly pompe. But ſome man will ſay, what, is it not good to build Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and Churches, that God may bee honoured thereby: I anſwere, it is good, ſo that the poore in the meane while crie not to God againſt ſuch. How can I build an houſe plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſing vnto God, or to his Saints of thoſe monies, for which the poore crie out? What iuſtice can it be to reward the dead, and to ſpoile the liuing, and out of the want of the poore to offer vnto God? Certes if this iuſtice ſhould
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:953:67"/>pleaſe God, he ſhould be the companion of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and if it diſpleaſeth God, it cannot pleaſe the Saints. Wherefore (moſt beloued ſonnes) as new borne babes, deſire the ſincere milke of the word, that yee may grow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, if ye haue taſted, how ſweet the Lord is. For verily, if ye be not as new born, Bibes, yea ſhall not enter into the kingdome of heauen. A new borne Babe ſeeing a faire woman is not delighted, behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding gorgeous apparell he doth not deſire it: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hurt he dwelleth not in anger, he doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, nor hate there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he followeth his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:953:67"/>and doth not forſake his mother. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let no man thinke, that he ſhall attaine the kingdome of heauen, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he be a follower of this innocencie, <hi>viz:</hi> of chaſtitie contempt of the world, of loue and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, following Chriſt, and reſting in the boſome of the church his mother. Put off (moſt beloued) the old man, and put on the armour of God, that yee may ſtand againſt the treacheries of the Deuill. Let your weapons, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ye fight, be chaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>itie, patience, humilitie, and charitie: for theſe are wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons againſt the ſubtleties of the Deuill, wherewith
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:953:68"/>if yee be armed, yee ſhall gird your loynes with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and ſtrengthen your arme, and when yee ſhall be in the battaile, yee ſhall laugh, your houſe ſhall truly be founded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſure rocke, which is Chriſt. Luxurie is the ſword of the Deuill, as how many doth he ſlay with that ſword, and there is no ſin, whereby the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill doth ſo often ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. For as chaſtitie doth equall a man vnto the Angels, ſo luxurie doth make a man like to the brute beaſts: yea, to ſpeake truly, it makes him worſe, than a beaſt. We doe not read of any other ſin, that God ſaid, that he
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:953:68"/>repented that hee made man for it. The workes of luxurie are theſe, it weakneth the body, and doth alwaies, as it were, deſtroy a man by death, it brands the good name, it emptieth the purſe, it ſets a worke to ſteale, it cauſeth murther, it dulls the memory, it takes away the heart, it blindes the eyes of either man, and prouokes the wrath of God aboue other ſinnes. It ſpringeth from gluttonie, as from a roote, and for no other ſin hath God exerciſed ſo manifeſt iudgement as for that, without all mercy. For this ſinne, God brought the flood vpon the world,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:953:69"/>he burnt Sodom, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah, and ſlew many other men. This is the net of the Deuill, if any man be taken herein, he is not ſoone let looſe againe. In this ſo grieuous a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile no men can ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, vnleſſe hee flies, none can firmely indure, vnleſſe he times the fleſh. He that vſeth wine, carries fire in his boſome. <hi>Be not drunken with wine,</hi> ſaith the A poſtle, <hi>where in is luxury.</hi> This brunt is not borne but by abſtinence, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting. Wine hurteth, but the countenance of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man an hundreth fold more. A beautifull wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is the deuils dart, whereby a man is ſoone
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:953:69"/>drawne into luxurie. Let no man liuing be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in this, if thou beeſt a Saint, yet thou art not ſecure. Can a man hide fire in his boſome, and his garments not burne? or walke vpon coales, and his feete not burne? A man &amp; a woman togither are fire and towe, and the Deuil neuer ceaſeth blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to kindle it. Many moſt holy men haue fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len by this vice for their ſecuritie, therefore feare (ô my ſonaes) and if in other ſinnes, much more in this. But, to ſpeake truly, a new kind of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication is committed by many of the ſpiritualty now a dayes. Alas, what
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:953:70"/>ſhall I ſay, men doe not now bluſh, but glory in doing euill. There is ſome kinde of baſhfulneſſe, tho but a litle in women; but in men this euill hath ſo increaſed, that he is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a foole, that is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert in theſe things. What ſhould I ſay more? This is their holy day keeping, this is their preaching for this come they to the Church, that they may ſee faire women, and that they may talke with them, that the deſire of filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe may the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe thereby. But (ô wretched man) why doſt thou glory in this euill? Thou ſinneſt an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth times more than the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:953:70"/>woman. Shee is weake, and thou thinkeſt thy ſelf ſtrong: ſhee ſitteth at home, and thou wandring abroad ſeekeſta thouſand waics to intangle hir, and ſometime compelleſt hir by force; and when thou doſt theſe things, becauſe God holds his peace, thou thinkeſt that hee is like vnto thee. But the time will come, wherein he will reproue thee, and ſet thy ſinnes before thy face. Wherefore (ô my ſonnes) be yee wiſe as ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, innocent as doues, &amp; fight manfully againſt the old ſerpent. O loue one another, I haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued this not of man, but of my Sauiour, who ſaith,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:953:71"/>
               <hi>This is my commandement, that yee loue one another.</hi> As out of one root many branches do ſpring, ſo out of charitie ſpring all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. If I ſpeake with the tongues of men, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and haue not loue, I am nothing, ſaith the Apoſtle. He that hath loue is benigne, and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. He hath true loue, which doth not only loue the neareſt vnto him by kindred, and in the fleſh, as the heathen doe, but which loueth his enemy, euen as his friend. By this one thing a man may know, that he abideth in loue, if he loueth him that is againſt him. There are very many that loue, but
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:953:71"/>they loue amiſſe, for in louing man they often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times looſe the loue of God. They which loue any thing more than God are not worthy of God. In all vertues temperance is required, vertue muſt alwaies keepe a meane. To loue too much, or too litle is euill. All loue, that hurteth, is to be anoyded. Through too much loue ſome haue fallen into fil thineſſe, through too litle ſome haue fallen into en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie. Ouer-much loue would alwaies ſee the thing, which it loueth. This loue is ignorant of iuſtice, and truth it wants reaſon, it knowes no mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, neither can it thinke
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:953:72"/>any thing, but that, which it loueth. It is impoſſible, that a man, which hath ſuch loue, ſhould offer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable prayers vnto God, or pleaſe God. This loue is not charitie, but folly. We ought to loue all our brethren, as our ſelues, but yet ſo, as that we loue not their vices. It is loue to puniſh ſinne, it is iuſt to loue more the better man. Men are ſo to be loued, that goodneſſe may be exalted, and vice diſgraced. He that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out true loue, is without God, becauſe God is loue, and loue is God. He that dwelleth in loue hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready begun to dwell in heauen. Where there is
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:953:72"/>true loue, there is no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie, no ambition, no back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting, no murmuring, or mocking, but one, and the ſame will. Therefore I beſeech you, whilſi yee haue time, that ye receiue not the grace of God in vaine. In this ſhort time of our life let vs ſow, and ſo we ſhall reape in due time. The dayes of man are ſhort; our life is cut off as a weauers threed, death commeth as a theefe, and euery mans workes follow him. Whilſt ye haue light, walke not in darknes, he that walketh in darkneſſe knoweth not whither be goeth. Your light is Chriſt, which doth ſhine in darkneſſe; come there
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:953:73"/>fore vnto him, the liuing ſtone, reiected indeede or men, but choſen of God, that yee as liuing ſtones may be built vpon him, and yee may carry your ſelues in all things, as the miniſters of God, in much patience, in tribulations, in neceſſities, in ſtreights, in ſcourges, in priſons, in labours, in faſtings, in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitie, in long-ſuffering, in the Holy Ghoſt, and in loue vnfained, in the word of truth, and in the virtue of God. Let there not be a lye told amongſt you, for euery lyer is abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto God. God is truth, and lying is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to truth. Flie euery idle word, for of euery
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:953:73"/>idle and vaine word, wee muſt giue accompt vnto God. Loue ſilence, where there is much talking, there cannot but be much lying. The ſpeech be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wraieth, what a man is. Let no word come from your mouth, which may not ſauour of Chriſt, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies meditate vpon Gods law. Surely nothing hurts a man more, then euill ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, for ſuch is a man made, as they are, whoſe ſociety hee vſeth. The Wolfe neuer dwells with the Lambe. A chaſt man flies the ſociety of the luxurious. I thinke it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtible for a man to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine long in good workes, that vſeth euill
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:953:74"/>ſociety euery day. <hi>With the holy,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>thou ſhalt be holy, with the innocent, thou ſhalt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necent, &amp; with the froward, thou ſhalt learne froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> For euen as euill company hurteth, ſo good companie profiteth, Nothing can be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to this treaſure, hee that hath found good Companions, hath found life, &amp; flowes with riches. And to ſpeake truely, ve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry ſeldome is a man made either good or euill, but by company. The heart of a child is like vnto a table, wherin nothing is (at the firſt) ingrauen; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what hee receiueth from company, he retein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:953:74"/>euen vnto old age, whether it be good, or bad. Let youth keepe company with men of yeares, and wiſedome: for if hee be linked to one like vnto himſelfe, by dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fellowſhippe, hee ſhall fall from folly, to folly. Aboue all things (my ſonnes) ſweare not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by heauen, not by earth, nor by any other Oath. Out of whoſe mouth, Oathes are heard, in him is little knowledge, and loue of God. If it be not true which I ſweare, I doe in effect denie God: for God hath for bidden, to take his name in vaine. Be inſtant in continuall prayers. Frequent, and
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:953:75"/>deuout prayer doth much auaile. Prayer doth lift vp a man from earth to heauen, and makes him to ſpeake with God. Hee obteineth grace of God, if his Prayer be deuout, and mixt with teares. <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zechiah</hi> (by his prayers, and teares) did preſently obtaine grace of the Lord, ſo that the ſentence was changed, which had bin denounced. At the praiers of <hi>Elias,</hi> the beauen gaue raine, which had beene ſhut vp three yeares, and ſix monethes. If ye want any thing, aske it of the Lord by prayer, and wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, being no whit doubtfull: for whoſoeuer hath faith, but ſo much as
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:953:75"/>a graine of muſtard ſeed, whatſoeuer he ſhall aske, ſhall be granted vnto him. The ſame Lord, that then was, is now alſo rich in all things: wherefore let God now be your hope, your ioy, your thinking, and your deſire. For of him, in him, and through him are all things, in whom we liue, and moue, and haue our being, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whom we are nothing. And now (ô my ſonnes) I ſhall not ſpeake many things to you, for the houre is come, vnto which I was borne, vpon this condition I came into the world, that I might goe out againe. The Lord ſpared not his owne ſon,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:953:76"/>but made them to die vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Croſſe for vs all, by whoſe death our death is dead: for none of vs liueth to himſelfe, but dieth, whether wee liue, we liue to the Lord, and if we die, we die to the Lord, therfore whether we liue, or die we are the Lords: and for this cauſe Chriſt is called the Lord of the liuing, and of the dead. For if Chriſt bee dead, ſurely the ſeruant is not about his Maſter, we muſt alſo die, and if he be riſen againe, we haue alſo moſt ſirme hope, that we ſhall riſe againe, and if he bee riſen to die no more, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall we die any more after our reſurrection, but
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:953:76"/>ſhall alway abide with him in glory. When Chriſt died, a man like vnto vs died, that the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of ſinne might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, that we might be made one body together with him. Wherefore (my beloued ſonnes) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I now die, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, that my Redeemer liueth, and that I ſhall riſe vp out of the earth, at the laſt day, and ſhall bee couered againe with this skinne, and in this my fleſh I ſhall ſee him my Sauiour, whom I my ſelfe ſhall ſee, who now ſpeake, whom ye ſee now dying, and not any other for me. And theſe very eies, whereby I now ſee you,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:953:77"/>ſhall looke vpon him. Wherefore reioice with me, and ſing, caſt away the garments of mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and heauineſſe, praiſe the Lord, ſing a Pſalme vnto his name, giue glorie to his praiſe, for hitherto I haue walked through fire, &amp; water, &amp; behold now he refreſheth me. I will enter into the houſe of the Lord, that I may pay my vowes from day to day. Oh how great a game it is to me to die? Becauſe Chriſt ſhall bee my life againe: Behold the earthly houſe of this habitation, is diſſolued, that another may ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede not made with hands, eternall in the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:953:77"/>heauens. Behold I put off this mortall cloathing, that I may put on immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall. Hitherto I haue bin in pilgrimage, now I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to my countrey. Behold I now receiue the prize, for which I ran in the race, I touch the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, which I haue deſired with ſo great a deſire. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I am carried from darkeneſſe to light, from dangers to ſafetie, from pouertie to riches, from battell to victorie, from heauineſſe to ioy, from a temporall life to eternall; and from a filthy ſtincke to a moſt ſweete ſmell. Here I am blinde, there I am inlightened, here I am wounded, there I am
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:953:78"/>healed, here I am alwaies made heauie, there I am made ioyfull, liuing here I am dead, there I am truely made aliue. The life, in this world, is no life, but death, a deceitfull life, a life loaden with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, weake, vmbrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, deceitfull. Now thou flouriſheſt, by and by thou withereſt, it is a fraile, a momentany, a fading life. Wherein looke how much thou groweſt, ſo much thou decreaſeſt, when thou goeſt more forward, thou draweſt nearer to death. O life full of ſnares, how many men doeſt thou intangle in the world? How many through thee doe indure
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:953:78"/>the torments of hell? How bleſſed is he, that acknowledgeth thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, how much more bleſſed is he, that careth not for thy flatteries, and how moſt bleſſed is hee, that is well rid of thee? O ſweete, and pleaſant death, thou art truely no death, that beſtoweſt true life. Thou putteſt away feuers and wounds, thou quencheſt hunger, and thirſt. O moſt juſt death, good vnto the good, and rough vnto the euill, thou humbleſt the proud, rich and mightie, and exalteſt the humble. Thou o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneſt the way to eternall puniſhment to the euill, and to eternall reward to
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:953:79"/>the iuſt. After theſe, and other graue, and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſpeeches, he vttered this heauenly praier fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>

Call me (ô the Guide of my life) and I will anſwer thee. Stretch foorth the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:953:79"/>right hand of thy clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie to the worke of thine owne hands, which thou (the creature of all things) haſt made of the mire of the earth, and ioyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with bones, and nerues, to whom thou dying haſt giuen life, and mercy. Bid me come (ô Lord) doe not delay, it is time that duſt returne to the duſt, and that the Spirit returne to thee the Sauiour, who haſt ſent it hither. Open to me the gate of life, for thou haſt promiſed mee, that thou wouldſt receiue it, when thou didſt hang vpon the croſſe for me. Come (my beloued) let me lay hold vpon thee, and not let
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:953:80"/>thee go, bring me into thy houſe. Thou art my Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker vp, my glorie, and the lifter vp of mine head, my ſaluation, and my bleſſing. Receiue me (ô mercifull God) according to the multitude of thy mercies. Thou dying, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuedſt the Theife vpon the Croſſe, running vnto thee.

Inlighte (with the light of thine eternall ſight) mee blinde man crying by the way, Ieſus, thou ſonne of <hi>Dauid,</hi> haue mercy vpon me. O inuiſible lights, what ioy can I haue, when I ſit in darkneſſe, and ſee not the light of heauen? O light, without which,

My ſoule is weary of my life, I ſpeake in the bitterneſſe of my ſoule, I am ſicke, my life is weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned through pouertie, my bones are fried, as it were in a frying pan. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I runne to thee Lord, the Phiſitian. Heale mee (O Lord) and I ſhall bee healed; ſaue me (ô Lord) and I ſhall be ſaued, and I ſhall not be confounded, becauſe I put my truſt in thee. But who am I (moſt holy God, that I ſhould
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:953:81"/>ſpeake ſo boldly vnto thee. I am a ſinner, alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether begotten, borne and brought vp in ſinnes.

O Lord, if thou wilt giue me leaue, I will ſay, that thou oughteſt not to put me away, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming vnto thee, becauſe thou art my God. Thy fleſh is of my fleſh, and thy bones of my bones:
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:953:81"/>For, for this cauſe, not leauing the right hand of the Father, thou haſt cleaued to my nature, and becameſt God, and man. And why didſt thou this ſo hard, and vnthought of thing, but that I might come confidently vnto thee, as vnto a brother, and that thou mighteſt mercifully communicate vnto me thy diety?

Truly I am not worthy to be called thy Sonne, for I haue ſinned againſt heauen, and before thee. Speake ioy, and comfort in mine eare, turne away thy face from my ſinnes, blot out mine iniquities according to thy great mercy.
