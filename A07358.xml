            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Neither the length of the way, the cold and wet of the winter, neither the bu≈øine≈ø≈øes of the world could hinder her feet from comming to the hou≈øe of God.

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:953:14"/>skill herein.

               <note place="margin">Acts 9.35.</note> her loue was exceeding great, both toward God, and towards her neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:953:15"/>glad when the Lord took the matter into his owne hands, by cha≈øtizing her with ≈øickne≈ø≈øe: for then, and in health time al≈øo, ≈øhee did much complaine of her ≈øinnes and forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulne≈ø≈øe, for which it was nece≈ø≈øary to be corrected. Her continuall bewailing, and often mourning, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen with teares, when wicked cur≈øed ≈øpeakers were in pre≈øence, did plainely ≈øhew ≈øuch an heart as <hi>Lots,</hi> ≈øo taken vp with the loue of God, as that hearing and ≈øeeing any thing again≈øt God,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2 8.</note> could not but vex the hart inwardly with ≈øorrow.</p>
            <p>Of her neighbour ≈øhee had al≈øo a true loue, not
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:953:16"/>in word, but in deed: She had loue of alme≈ø-deeds, which ≈øhe plentifully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to the poore, as <hi>Iob,</hi>

               <hi>their loines ble≈ø≈øed her, for that they were kept warme with her fleeces.</hi> While≈øt ≈øhee liued, the hungry could not goe vnfed, the naked vncloathed, the ≈øicke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ui≈øited, plentifully the Lord had dealt vnto her, plentifully ≈øhe gaue to the Lord againe in his poore members, appointing continuall releefe to bee giuen to the ≈øick and nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, in ≈øuch places of great
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:953:16"/>pouerty, as wherein ≈øhee liued not. 2 She ≈øhewed loue, by admoni≈øhing the di≈øorderly, in≈øtructing the ignorant, and exhorting the backward in religion, by all meanes prouoking to loue and good workes. O how great was her care, that her whole hou≈øhold and all her neighbours might ≈øerue the Lord, that it might goe well with them for euer. 3 Her loue was exceeding great to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Gods Mini≈øters and all Saints, reioycing alwaies to entertaine ≈øuch, and to be in their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. 4 Her loue was ≈øuch towards all, as that ≈øhee would not giue offence to any, by ≈øpeaking ill of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:953:17"/>them, neither did ≈øhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light as many do, to heare ill reports again≈øt others. Wherefore her religion was not vaine,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.</note> as all is without loue, but it was a true religion, her purity was in heart and in truth, and ble≈ø≈øed are the pure in heart,<note place="margin">Mat. 5.1.</note> for they ≈øhall ≈øee God. Her life was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall laying vp of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure in heauen, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ≈øhe could not but ≈øee heauen to be her dwelling place.

Do not honor a rich man more than a poore man, vnle≈ø≈øe he be better: Yea, that I may ≈øpeake truly, honor rather a poore man; for in a poore man doth ≈øhine the image of Chri≈øt, in a rich man the image of the world.

But becau≈øe I am ≈øpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of tho≈øe that do glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in their fading riches, and of tho≈øe, that are proud of a certaine nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of the filthy fle≈øh, which is ≈øoone to returne to a≈øhes, and of vaine, and light power and dignitie (for they are lifted vp by the bla≈øt of ≈øome fooli≈øh titles, and doe tread o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers vnder feete through contempt, and by this they thinke, that they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that glory, which the Lord hath prepared onely for the humble, and for the contemners of this world) what ≈øhould I ≈øpeake of them, as it is
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:953:49"/>meete? woe to you that ha≈øten to the kingdome of heauen through the way of riches, ≈øeeing that it is ea≈øier for a camell to goe through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdome of heauen. The≈øe are not my words, but the words of Chri≈øt; if this ≈øentence be reuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, Chri≈øt is no more God. The <hi>heauen and the earth</hi> (≈øaith he) <hi>≈øhall pa≈ø≈øe away, but my words ≈øhall not pa≈ø≈øe away.</hi> Bewaile (√¥ ye mi≈øerable Nobles, and Potentates) the titles of vn≈ølable fortune, becau≈øe yee are blinded with the fumes of the honours, and falfe dignities of this
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:953:50"/>world, when as the threed of your brittle life ≈øhall peraduenture be cut off this night, and ye ≈øhall be tormented in hell, more than others, world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end, liuing in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall dying. Yee are not among≈øt the labourers in the world; yea ye do not onely not indure labour with men, but ye doe not ≈øuffer the laborers to liue; therfore ye ≈øhall be ≈øcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged not with men, but with deuils. For by how much your glory, and ioy hath bin the greater in this world, by ≈øo much the greater puni≈øhment is prepared for you in hell. We confe≈ø≈øe, that Chri≈øt cho≈øe twelue Apo≈øtles,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:953:50"/>among≈øt whom <hi>Bartholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mew</hi> onely was of noble de≈øcent, and <hi>Matthew</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was rich, before that he was receiued into the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øtle≈øhip, the re≈øt were poore fi≈øhermen. Now heare wherfore I haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated this. If Chri≈øt be true, and all, which I haue heard out of his mouth he true, among≈øt ≈øuch kinde of men, ≈øcar≈øe one of a thou≈øand is to be ≈øound fit for the kingdome of heauen. But ≈øuch of them, as doe not beleeue mee, ≈øhall after a ≈øhort time feele it, when they are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in torments. Yet ≈øome man blinded from the light of the truth, will now maruaile: to whom,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:953:51"/>if hee would aske mee hereabout, I would an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer. Do we not beleeue, that a man is damned for one ≈øinne? and if it be ≈øo, how can he be ≈øaued, that liueth in an hundreth thou≈øand ≈øins? But what other thing is the rich man, fed with the ayre of fading honour, but a rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ve≈ø≈øell full of all ≈øins? Where is couetou≈øne≈ø≈øe? where is pride? Is it not in the rich, in the noble, in the great ones? Are they not al≈øo theeues, which doe violently prey vpon the hire of the poore? and pre≈ø≈øe them downe, and kill them? who dowicked things out of the plenty of the Lords
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:953:51"/>hou≈øe, which they haue receiued, that they might giue to the poore? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely they adde to ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluitie in dyet, ≈øuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluitie in apparell, hauing no regard to the poore, that dye through cold &amp; nakednes. They reare vp pallaces, and great buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, that they may be ≈øeene, when the poore dye in the ≈øtreets. They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide fea≈øts often for other rich men, that they may fill their bellies with mo≈øt delicate di≈øhes, when the poore peri≈øh through ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. What other is their life but ≈øinne? if the belly be filled with ≈øuch plenty of meate, is not ≈øurfet at the doores? And what
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:953:52"/>≈øhould I ≈øay more, when the tongue of euery man would faile in telling the thou≈øands of ≈øins, which they do? Neither do they acknowledg God, vnle≈ø≈øe it be by dreame; neither do they thinke, that they ≈øhall dye, as I ≈øuppo≈øe: for he that thinketh that he ≈øhall dye, and that God ≈øhall iudge him, doth not ea≈øily fall into ≈øinne. He is verily ouer weake, and mi≈øerable, that hath not the remembrance of the≈øe things. Therfore to ≈øpeake truly, if they did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge God their iudge, and beleeued, that they heard, they would at the lea≈øt wi≈øe not ≈øinne ≈øo ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely. Why doe the≈øe
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:953:52"/>mo≈øt milerable men goe to the Church to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent at diuine my≈øteries? whether that they may behold the countenances of faire women? this is their meditation, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and knowledge of God. If they looke into Gods law, it is but, that trauailing by ≈øea, or by land, they may gather money to them≈øelues, and their children by often watches, and di≈øtractions of minde, that they may be the fir≈øt in changing their ≈øuites, through the wonderfull inuention of the workeman. But mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerable men, what do yee, doe yee not con≈øider, that you de≈øtroy your bodie
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:953:53"/>before the time, and ≈ølay your ≈øoule? whence come weakne≈ø≈øes, &amp; ≈øo vntime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deaths, but of the much plenty of meats, and of the often v≈øe of women? Doe ye thinke to mocke God? yee doe certainely mocke your ≈øelues: for the body yee forget the ≈øoule, and ye de≈øtroy both bodie and ≈øoule before the time. But delay not to do, what ye do; change your garments often, le≈øt your Nobilitie ≈øhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, if any man ≈øhould exceede you, that ye may receiue ≈øhame and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion in hell. Where ≈øhall your fea≈øts, where ≈øhall your delicare di≈øhes then be, where your co≈øtly

Take your comfort in ≈øurfets, fulfill your plea≈øures, ≈øowe in corruption, that of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption ye may reape that ≈øentence, which the iu≈øt iudge will giue in the great day of iudgement, ≈øaying, <hi>Goe yee cur≈øed into heli ≈øire, prepared for the Deuill, and his angels.</hi> O ≈øtenle heart! that do≈øt not feare, that ≈øuch a doome hangeth ouer thy head, for the ≈ølender comforts
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:953:54"/>of this world. If thou loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke≈øt for that day ≈øo terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and cruell, wherein thou ≈øhalt giue account, not onely for thy ≈øurfets, and vaine apparell, and drunkenne≈ø≈øe, and of thy time lo≈øt, but al≈øo of euery euill thought, why art thou not amended? Why do≈øt thou wretch deferre from day to day to turne vnto the Lord? why do≈øt thou not now repent thee of thy ≈øinnes? Behold, death maketh ha≈øte, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning night and day, that it may teare thee in peeces: behold the Deuill ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth ha≈øte to catch thee: behold thy riches ≈øhall faile thee; behold the wormes waite for that

Why do≈øt thou ≈øeeke comfort by va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, wandring in the by-waies of this world? Thou can≈øt not finde true riches, and glory, and plea≈øant things here, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe they are not: but if thou ≈øeeke≈øt for true ioyes, ha≈øten to that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly glory, for which thou wert made. There doubtle≈ø≈øe are tho≈øe true ioyes, which the eye hath not ≈øeene, nor the care heard, nor the heart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued. Let goe (I pray

But why doe I ≈øpeake of the≈øe men, that will not cea≈øe from ≈øinne, through loue and feare of God, or for the terror of death, and torments following after, but are grieued, if they cannot doe the wicked things, which they de≈øire?

Behold, ye haue but a litle time remaining, fill vp the mea≈øure of your wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe, that all the wrath of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:953:55"/>God may come vpon you. Enioy this ≈øhort time in ≈øports, drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe, and dancings, and wantonne≈ø≈øe: let not your time bee ≈øpent without the≈øe. Why delay you, whil≈øt yee liue, gather for your children riches, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, preferments, increa≈øe your nobilitie, and name, that your children al≈øo may fulfill that, which ye haue done, that yee may altogither ≈øuffer the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter tortures in hell. But ≈øome man will ≈øay, the Lord is good, and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and receiueth in mercy euery ≈øinner that commeth vnto him. This is true indeede I confe≈ø≈øe, the Lord is better, than he
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:953:56"/>is thought to be, he ≈øpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, as is meet, euery one, that commeth vnto him. Is he not a mo≈øt kinde God, that tolerateth ≈øo great iniuries done vnto him by ≈øinners, giuing them ≈øpace to amend? But thou mu≈øt know this, that as he is kinde in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing ≈øo he is iu≈øt in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhing. But ≈øome man, perchance, will ≈øay again; he which hath done euill all his life, becomming penitent at the very point of death, obteineth par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of the Lord. O how fal≈øe an opinion, and how fal≈øe a meditation is this? Scarce one of a hundreth thou≈øand, who≈øe life hath bin alwaies ill, hath found
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:953:56"/>this fauour at the Lords hands. A man begotten, and altogither nouri≈øhed vp in ≈øinne, which hath neither ≈øeene nor knowne God, neither hath bin wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to heare of him, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther taketh notice of his ≈øins, nor what repentance is, being altogither bound vp in ≈øecular bu≈øine≈ø≈øes, whom the ≈øtrait of for≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his ≈øonnes pre≈ø≈øeth, whom weaknes paineth, whom the ≈øorrow of rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and temporall goods now about to be lo≈øt ≈øha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, when he ≈øeeth, that he cannot enioy them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny longer, can ≈øuch a man make repentance accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table vnto God, who would not repent, if he
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:953:57"/>did thinke, that he could be healed? I may verily conclude truly, that he which doth not feare to offend God, whil≈øt he is young, and ≈øound, ≈øhall not be found worthy in death of the Lords par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. What repentance is that, which a man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth only, becau≈øe he ≈øeeth, that he can liue no longer? who, if he ≈øhould recouer from his ≈øick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe againe, would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come wor≈øe than he was before. I know no meane monyed men, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing repented them in their extremide, haue waxed well againe in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and wor≈øe in life. I hold this, I thinke this to
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:953:57"/>be true, and haue learned it by manifold experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that he atteineth no good end, that hath alway led an ill life, which hath not ≈øeared to ≈øin, but hath alwaies liued in the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the world. Pretious (≈øaith he) in the ≈øight of the Lord, is the death of his Saints, and mo≈øt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur≈øed the death of the wicked. And therefore (my beloued ≈øonnes) gird your ≈øelues with power, be ye mighty ≈øonnes, and feare not the ≈ølender power of the rich &amp; migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty here, in the doing of righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe. For he, that ≈øuffereth for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øne≈ø≈øe is ble≈ø≈øed, and if he ≈øuffereth death, he is
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:953:58"/>more ble≈ø≈øed. If thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øire≈øt to haue life through Chri≈øt, feare not death for Chri≈øt: for thou can≈øt not indure tho≈øe things for Chri≈øt, which are worthy of the glory to come, which ≈øhall bee reuealed, when our glory, which is from aboue, ≈øhall appeare. Let him not looke for a reward that doth not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; the name of a Chri≈øtian alone doth not ≈øuffice, but if thou bee≈øt a Chri≈øtian, imitate Chri≈øt. Hee hath in vaine the name of a Chri≈øtian, who followeth the Deuill. He is no Chri≈øtian, but an Antichri≈øt, according to that of <hi>Iohn: Ye haue heard that Antichri≈øt commeth, &amp;

O how foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øh are we, and ≈ølow of heart to beleeue? We will here pa≈ø≈øe our time in plea≈øure with the world, and afterwards reigne with Chri≈øt. Seeing the ma≈øter entred naked, ≈øhall the ≈øeruant expect to enter being laden with the ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluitie of apparell of gold and pearles? He was full of fa≈øtings, this man
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:953:59"/>of ≈øurfets and ryotings: he died vpon the cro≈ø≈øe for him, this man ≈øleepeth vpon a delicate bed. Shall ≈øeruants do that, which the Lord doth not? The Lord promi≈øeth his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to the ≈øonnes of <hi>Zebedee,</hi> if they could drinke the cup, that he ≈øhould drinke. Be yee wi≈øe, come hither, and heare me, and I will tell you the things, which I haue heard and knowne. It is good to cleaue to the Lord, and to walke, as he hath walked. Euen as Chri≈øt hath laid downe his life for vs, ≈øo we, if need be, ought to lay downe our life for the truth, which is God him≈øelfe. He
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:953:59"/>that loueth his life in this world, ≈øhall loo≈øe it. Chri≈øt hath ≈øuffered for vs, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vnto vs an example, that we ≈øhould follow his ≈øteps. Let him not thinke him≈øelf a Chri≈øtian, which doth not finde him≈øelfe ready to die for Chri≈øt Let the mini≈øter of Chri≈øt follow Chri≈øt. An≈øwer me (√¥ thou man) which art a Chri≈øtian onely in name and in word: do≈øt thou hold and preach the faith of Chri≈øt? this is a good thing, but where be thy workes? faith without workes is dead. Let mee tell thee truly, thou which prai≈øe≈øt Chri≈øt with thy word, and not with thy worke, doe≈øt indeed denie
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:953:60"/>who if thou did≈øt beleeue his ≈øayings, thou would≈øt at the lea≈øt be afraid, and blu≈øh to commit ≈øinne.

Is not the ≈øin, which is done out of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice infinitely wor≈øe, than that which is done out of ignorance? The Angell ≈øinned, and the man ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the one could finde pardon, the other not.

And what ≈øhall I conclude? they that are ≈øuch Chri≈øtians beleeue him in word, and lye vnto him with their tongue, but their heart is not right with him, neither haue they faith in his te≈øtament. If any man loueth Chri≈øt, if any man be a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian, &amp; ≈øpecially a Prie≈øt, in whom, as it were in a gla≈ø≈øe, perfection doth

Wherefore (mo≈øt beloued ≈øonnes) as new borne babes, de≈øire the ≈øincere milke of the word, that yee may grow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, if ye haue ta≈øted, how ≈øweet the Lord is.

Put off (mo≈øt beloued) the old man, and put on the armour of God, that yee may ≈øtand again≈øt the treacheries of the Deuill.

Luxurie is the ≈øword of the Deuill, as how many doth he ≈ølay with that ≈øword, and there is no ≈øin, whereby the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill doth ≈øo often ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. For as cha≈øtitie doth equall a man vnto the Angels, ≈øo luxurie doth make a man like to the brute bea≈øts: yea, to ≈øpeake truly, it makes him wor≈øe, than a bea≈øt. We doe not read of any other ≈øin, that God ≈øaid, that he
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:953:68"/>repented that hee made man for it. The workes of luxurie are the≈øe, it weakneth the body, and doth alwaies, as it were, de≈øtroy a man by death, it brands the good name, it emptieth the pur≈øe, it ≈øets a worke to ≈øteale, it cau≈øeth murther, it dulls the memory, it takes away the heart, it blindes the eyes of either man, and prouokes the wrath of God aboue other ≈øinnes. It ≈øpringeth from gluttonie, as from a roote, and for no other ≈øin hath God exerci≈øed ≈øo manife≈øt iudgement as for that, without all mercy. For this ≈øinne, God brought the flood vpon the world,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:953:69"/>he burnt Sodom, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah, and ≈ølew many other men. This is the net of the Deuill, if any man be taken herein, he is not ≈øoone let loo≈øe againe. In this ≈øo grieuous a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile no men can ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, vnle≈ø≈øe hee flies, none can firmely indure, vnle≈ø≈øe he times the fle≈øh. He that v≈øeth wine, carries fire in his bo≈øome. <hi>Be not drunken with wine,</hi> ≈øaith the A po≈øtle, <hi>where in is luxury.</hi> This brunt is not borne but by ab≈øtinence, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øting. Wine hurteth, but the countenance of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man an hundreth fold more. A beautifull wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is the deuils dart, whereby a man is ≈øoone
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:953:69"/>drawne into luxurie. Let no man liuing be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in this, if thou bee≈øt a Saint, yet thou art not ≈øecure. Can a man hide fire in his bo≈øome, and his garments not burne? or walke vpon coales, and his feete not burne? A man &amp; a woman togither are fire and towe, and the Deuil neuer cea≈øeth blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to kindle it. Many mo≈øt holy men haue fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len by this vice for their ≈øecuritie, therefore feare (√¥ my ≈øonaes) and if in other ≈øinnes, much more in this. But, to ≈øpeake truly, a new kind of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication is committed by many of the ≈øpiritualty now a dayes. Alas, what
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:953:70"/>≈øhall I ≈øay, men doe not now blu≈øh, but glory in doing euill. There is ≈øome kinde of ba≈øhfulne≈ø≈øe, tho but a litle in women; but in men this euill hath ≈øo increa≈øed, that he is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a foole, that is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert in the≈øe things. What ≈øhould I ≈øay more? This is their holy day keeping, this is their preaching for this come they to the Church, that they may ≈øee faire women, and that they may talke with them, that the de≈øire of filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe may the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea≈øe thereby. But (√¥ wretched man) why do≈øt thou glory in this euill? Thou ≈øinne≈øt an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth times more than the

Shee is weake, and thou thinke≈øt thy ≈øelf ≈øtrong: ≈øhee ≈øitteth at home, and thou wandring abroad ≈øeeke≈øta thou≈øand waics to intangle hir, and ≈øometime compelle≈øt hir by force; and when thou do≈øt the≈øe things, becau≈øe God holds his peace, thou thinke≈øt that hee is like vnto thee. But the time will come, wherein he will reproue thee, and ≈øet thy ≈øinnes before thy face. Wherefore (√¥ my ≈øonnes) be yee wi≈øe as ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, innocent as doues, &amp; fight manfully again≈øt the old ≈øerpent. O loue one another, I haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued this not of man, but of my Sauiour, who ≈øaith,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:953:71"/>
               <hi>This is my commandement, that yee loue one another.</hi> As out of one root many branches do ≈øpring, ≈øo out of charitie ≈øpring all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. If I ≈øpeake with the tongues of men, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and haue not loue, I am nothing, ≈øaith the Apo≈øtle. He that hath loue is benigne, and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. He hath true loue, which doth not only loue the neare≈øt vnto him by kindred, and in the fle≈øh, as the heathen doe, but which loueth his enemy, euen as his friend. By this one thing a man may know, that he abideth in loue, if he loueth him that is again≈øt him. There are very many that loue, but
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:953:71"/>they loue ami≈ø≈øe, for in louing man they often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times loo≈øe the loue of God. They which loue any thing more than God are not worthy of God. In all vertues temperance is required, vertue mu≈øt alwaies keepe a meane. To loue too much, or too litle is euill. All loue, that hurteth, is to be anoyded. Through too much loue ≈øome haue fallen into fil thine≈ø≈øe, through too litle ≈øome haue fallen into en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie. Ouer-much loue would alwaies ≈øee the thing, which it loueth. This loue is ignorant of iu≈øtice, and truth it wants rea≈øon, it knowes no mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure, neither can it thinke
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:953:72"/>any thing, but that, which it loueth. It is impo≈ø≈øible, that a man, which hath ≈øuch loue, ≈øhould offer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable prayers vnto God, or plea≈øe God. This loue is not charitie, but folly. We ought to loue all our brethren, as our ≈øelues, but yet ≈øo, as that we loue not their vices. It is loue to puni≈øh ≈øinne, it is iu≈øt to loue more the better man. Men are ≈øo to be loued, that goodne≈ø≈øe may be exalted, and vice di≈øgraced. He that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out true loue, is without God, becau≈øe God is loue, and loue is God. He that dwelleth in loue hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready begun to dwell in heauen. Where there is
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:953:72"/>true loue, there is no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie, no ambition, no back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting, no murmuring, or mocking, but one, and the ≈øame will. Therefore I be≈øeech you, whil≈øi yee haue time, that ye receiue not the grace of God in vaine. In this ≈øhort time of our life let vs ≈øow, and ≈øo we ≈øhall reape in due time. The dayes of man are ≈øhort; our life is cut off as a weauers threed, death commeth as a theefe, and euery mans workes follow him. Whil≈øt ye haue light, walke not in darknes, he that walketh in darkne≈ø≈øe knoweth not whither be goeth. Your light is Chri≈øt, which doth ≈øhine in darkne≈ø≈øe; come there
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:953:73"/>fore vnto him, the liuing ≈øtone, reiected indeede or men, but cho≈øen of God, that yee as liuing ≈øtones may be built vpon him, and yee may carry your ≈øelues in all things, as the mini≈øters of God, in much patience, in tribulations, in nece≈ø≈øities, in ≈øtreights, in ≈øcourges, in pri≈øons, in labours, in fa≈øtings, in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitie, in long-≈øuffering, in the Holy Gho≈øt, and in loue vnfained, in the word of truth, and in the virtue of God. Let there not be a lye told among≈øt you, for euery lyer is abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto God. God is truth, and lying is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øite to truth. Flie euery idle word, for of euery
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:953:73"/>idle and vaine word, wee mu≈øt giue accompt vnto God. Loue ≈øilence, where there is much talking, there cannot but be much lying. The ≈øpeech be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wraieth, what a man is. Let no word come from your mouth, which may not ≈øauour of Chri≈øt, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies meditate vpon Gods law. Surely nothing hurts a man more, then euill ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, for ≈øuch is a man made, as they are, who≈øe ≈øociety hee v≈øeth. The Wolfe neuer dwells with the Lambe. A cha≈øt man flies the ≈øociety of the luxurious. I thinke it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øtible for a man to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine long in good workes, that v≈øeth euill
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:953:74"/>≈øociety euery day. <hi>With the holy,</hi> ≈øaith the P≈øalmi≈øt, <hi>thou ≈øhalt be holy, with the innocent, thou ≈øhalt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necent, &amp; with the froward, thou ≈øhalt learne froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe.</hi> For euen as euill company hurteth, ≈øo good companie profiteth, Nothing can be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to this trea≈øure, hee that hath found good Companions, hath found life, &amp; flowes with riches. And to ≈øpeake truely, ve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry ≈øeldome is a man made either good or euill, but by company. The heart of a child is like vnto a table, wherin nothing is (at the fir≈øt) ingrauen; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what hee receiueth from company, he retein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:953:74"/>euen vnto old age, whether it be good, or bad. Let youth keepe company with men of yeares, and wi≈øedome: for if hee be linked to one like vnto him≈øelfe, by dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fellow≈øhippe, hee ≈øhall fall from folly, to folly. Aboue all things (my ≈øonnes) ≈øweare not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by heauen, not by earth, nor by any other Oath. Out of who≈øe mouth, Oathes are heard, in him is little knowledge, and loue of God. If it be not true which I ≈øweare, I doe in effect denie God: for God hath for bidden, to take his name in vaine. Be in≈øtant in continuall prayers. Frequent, and
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:953:75"/>deuout prayer doth much auaile. Prayer doth lift vp a man from earth to heauen, and makes him to ≈øpeake with God. Hee obteineth grace of God, if his Prayer be deuout, and mixt with teares. <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zechiah</hi> (by his prayers, and teares) did pre≈øently obtaine grace of the Lord, ≈øo that the ≈øentence was changed, which had bin denounced. At the praiers of <hi>Elias,</hi> the beauen gaue raine, which had beene ≈øhut vp three yeares, and ≈øix monethes. If ye want any thing, aske it of the Lord by prayer, and wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, being no whit doubtfull: for who≈øoeuer hath faith, but ≈øo much as
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:953:75"/>a graine of mu≈øtard ≈øeed, what≈øoeuer he ≈øhall aske, ≈øhall be granted vnto him. The ≈øame Lord, that then was, is now al≈øo rich in all things: wherefore let God now be your hope, your ioy, your thinking, and your de≈øire. For of him, in him, and through him are all things, in whom we liue, and moue, and haue our being, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whom we are nothing. And now (√¥ my ≈øonnes) I ≈øhall not ≈øpeake many things to you, for the houre is come, vnto which I was borne, vpon this condition I came into the world, that I might goe out againe. The Lord ≈øpared not his owne ≈øon,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:953:76"/>but made them to die vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Cro≈ø≈øe for vs all, by who≈øe death our death is dead: for none of vs liueth to him≈øelfe, but dieth, whether wee liue, we liue to the Lord, and if we die, we die to the Lord, therfore whether we liue, or die we are the Lords: and for this cau≈øe Chri≈øt is called the Lord of the liuing, and of the dead. For if Chri≈øt bee dead, ≈øurely the ≈øeruant is not about his Ma≈øter, we mu≈øt al≈øo die, and if he be ri≈øen againe, we haue al≈øo mo≈øt ≈øirme hope, that we ≈øhall ri≈øe againe, and if he bee ri≈øen to die no more, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øhall we die any more after our re≈øurrection, but
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:953:76"/>≈øhall alway abide with him in glory. When Chri≈øt died, a man like vnto vs died, that the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of ≈øinne might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtroyed, that we might be made one body together with him. Wherefore (my beloued ≈øonnes) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I now die, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, that my Redeemer liueth, and that I ≈øhall ri≈øe vp out of the earth, at the la≈øt day, and ≈øhall bee couered againe with this skinne, and in this my fle≈øh I ≈øhall ≈øee him my Sauiour, whom I my ≈øelfe ≈øhall ≈øee, who now ≈øpeake, whom ye ≈øee now dying, and not any other for me. And the≈øe very eies, whereby I now ≈øee you,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:953:77"/>≈øhall looke vpon him. Wherefore reioice with me, and ≈øing, ca≈øt away the garments of mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and heauine≈ø≈øe, prai≈øe the Lord, ≈øing a P≈øalme vnto his name, giue glorie to his prai≈øe, for hitherto I haue walked through fire, &amp; water, &amp; behold now he refre≈øheth me. I will enter into the hou≈øe of the Lord, that I may pay my vowes from day to day. Oh how great a game it is to me to die? Becau≈øe Chri≈øt ≈øhall bee my life againe: Behold the earthly hou≈øe of this habitation, is di≈ø≈øolued, that another may ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede not made with hands, eternall in the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:953:77"/>heauens. Behold I put off this mortall cloathing, that I may put on immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall. Hitherto I haue bin in pilgrimage, now I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to my countrey. Behold I now receiue the prize, for which I ran in the race, I touch the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, which I haue de≈øired with ≈øo great a de≈øire. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I am carried from darkene≈ø≈øe to light, from dangers to ≈øafetie, from pouertie to riches, from battell to victorie, from heauine≈ø≈øe to ioy, from a temporall life to eternall; and from a filthy ≈øtincke to a mo≈øt ≈øweete ≈ømell. Here I am blinde, there I am inlightened, here I am wounded, there I am
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:953:78"/>healed, here I am alwaies made heauie, there I am made ioyfull, liuing here I am dead, there I am truely made aliue. The life, in this world, is no life, but death, a deceitfull life, a life loaden with ≈øor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, weake, vmbrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, deceitfull.
